Edward Perman Cole died in May. it was a Sunday afternoon and there wasn't a cloud in the sky.

爱德华 · 佩瑞曼 · 科尔在五月一个周日下午去世了，那天天空万里无云。

it's difficult to understand the sum of a person's life. Some people would tell you it's measured by the ones left behind, some believe that it can be measured in faith, some say by love, other folks say life has no meaning at all ...

人生的功过是非很难衡量的。有人说取决于他所留下的事物，有人说由信仰来评定，也有人说爱能衡量，还有人说人生根本没有任何意义...

Me, I believe that you measure yourself by the people who measure themselves by you.

而我相信你可以用那些以你为标准的人来衡量自己。

What I can tell you for sure is that by any measure, Edward Cole lived more in his last days on earth than most people manage to wring out of a lifetime. I know that when he died his eyes were closed and his heart was open . . .

而我所能肯定的就是，无论你采用什么样的标准，爱德华 · 科尔在这世上活着的最后的日子比大多数人穷其一生的日子还要充实。我知道当他去世时，他的眼睛是闭上了，而他的心灵却是敞开的。
